This is a DLL for Project DIVA MM+ that moves the skin layer displayed at the top and bottom during the rhythm game from the front to the back.
In a mod that replaces skin images, the skin images are displayed in front of the melody icons, hindering gameplay. Therefore, this DLL is used in combination with the mod.
